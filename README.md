By analyzing historical data, the project aims to optimize menu offerings, staffing, and marketing strategies. Power BI dashboards visualize insight.
Indian Restaurant 2023 Prediction Repository
Description
Welcome to the Indian Restaurant 2023 Prediction repository! This project aims to leverage data analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast key metrics for Indian restaurants, helping them make informed decisions and optimize their operations. With the increasing competition in the food industry, our predictive models will provide insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and operational efficiency.

Project Overview
In this project, we will gather historical data from various Indian restaurants, analyze it, and build predictive models to forecast future performance metrics. The main objectives of this project are:

Sales Forecasting: Predict monthly sales for the upcoming year based on historical trends.
Customer Segmentation: Identify different customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
Menu Optimization: Determine which dishes are likely to perform best in the coming months.
Staffing Needs: Predict peak times and suggest optimal staffing levels.
Tech Stack
Languages: Python, SQL
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment: Flask or Streamlit for the web app
Step-by-Step Project Breakdown
Data Collection:

Gather historical sales data from various sources, including POS systems, online orders, and delivery apps.
Collect demographic data about customers, including age, preferences, and ordering frequency.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Transform categorical data into numerical formats as needed for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilize visualizations to identify trends in sales, peak hours, and popular dishes.
Analyze customer demographics to understand purchasing behaviors.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that could enhance the predictive power of our models, such as day of the week, holidays, and seasonal variations.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict sales and other metrics.
Evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Model Selection and Tuning:

Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
Visualization and Reporting:

Create interactive dashboards in Power BI to present key insights, such as:
Monthly sales predictions
Top-selling dishes
Customer segmentation insights
Staffing recommendations based on predicted peak hours
Export dashboards as reports for restaurant management.
Deployment:

Package the project into a web application using Flask or Streamlit, allowing users to input data and view predictions in real time.
Deploy the application on a cloud service such as Heroku or AWS for accessibility.
Future Work:

Incorporate customer feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the models.
Extend the project to include inventory management predictions and marketing campaign effectiveness.
Sample Power BI Dashboard Outputs
Monthly Sales Forecast: A line chart showing predicted sales over the next 12 months, highlighting peak seasons.
Top-Selling Dishes: A bar graph ranking the top 10 dishes by predicted sales volume, enabling targeted promotions.
Customer Segmentation: A scatter plot illustrating different customer segments based on spending habits and frequency of visits.
Staffing Recommendations: A heatmap indicating optimal staffing levels for each day and time of the week based on predicted customer volume.
By implementing this project, Indian restaurants can not only enhance their operational efficiency but also create a better dining experience tailored to customer preferences.
